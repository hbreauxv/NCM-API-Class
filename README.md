# NCM-API-Class
Working with the NCM API, made easy.  This repository is my attempt to use what i've been learning about OOP and make some classes for the NCM API that "just work".  They handle the basics so that you don't have to. 

NCM_API.py contains a class to assist you with managing configurations using the NCM API.

NCM_API.NCMRouterConfig is for getting, putting, and patching configuration to routers in NCM

This script is a work in progress.  Made by Harvey Breaux for use with Cradlepoint.
